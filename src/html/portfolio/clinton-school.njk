                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <!-- My testimonial here -->
                    <p>This multi-phase engagement for a prestigious University of Arkansas institution encompassed three core deliverables:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Platform Modernization:</strong> Transitioned from WordPress to a custom Laravel-based CMS designed for intuitive content management, significantly reducing training overhead for administrative staff.</li>
                        <li><strong>Content Migration:</strong> Executed bulk migration of 2,000+ blog posts from the legacy platform while preserving content integrity and URL structures.</li>
                        <li><strong>Payment Integration:</strong> Developed a secure donation portal integrated with CyberSource (Visa) payment processing, supporting both one-time and recurring contributions to designated scholarship funds.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>I architected and implemented the backend CMS modules enabling full CRUD operations across all content types. Beyond initial development, I managed ongoing ADA accessibility compliance using Monsido scanning tools, implementing monthly remediation cycles to maintain WCAG standards.</p>
                    <p>This project demonstrates my ability to deliver enterprise-grade solutions for higher education institutions with stringent accessibility and security requirements.</p>
