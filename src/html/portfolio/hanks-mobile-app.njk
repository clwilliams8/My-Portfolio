                                    <!-- My testimonial here -->
                                        <p>This project required balancing rapid deployment timelines with custom functionality requirements. After conducting a build-vs-buy analysis, I selected GoodBarber's Progressive Web App platform for its cross-platform capabilities and streamlined App Store submission process—a critical consideration given Apple's rigorous review requirements for app quality and user value.</p>

                                        <p>While the platform provided robust pre-built components, I developed custom HTML/CSS modules to meet specific business requirements. This included a Delivery Tracking page integrated with the company's logistics API, enabling customers to monitor their furniture orders in real-time by entering their order number. I also built a Financing portal providing streamlined access to payment options. Additionally, I created all launch screen assets using Adobe Photoshop, ensuring brand consistency across iOS, Android, phone, and tablet form factors.</p>

                                        <p>The application was successfully published to both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store within two weeks of project initiation—demonstrating effective technology selection, efficient execution, and the ability to extend platform capabilities through custom development when business requirements demand it.</p>
