                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <!-- My testimonial here -->
                    <p>The most technically interesting aspect of this project was implementing the dynamic mascot announcement system for the homepage hero section. The client's mascot, Willy Wirehands, serves as a personable communication channel between the cooperative and its members—appearing with a speech bubble when administrators activate an announcement, or cheerfully waving from behind the hero content when no announcement is active.</p>

                    <p>This conditional rendering system required careful coordination between the CMS backend (where administrators toggle announcements and compose messages) and the frontend display logic that determines Willy's positioning and visibility state. The implementation ensures seamless transitions while maintaining the playful brand personality the cooperative wanted to convey.</p>

                    <p>The broader platform migration addressed the client's core pain points: restructuring disorganized content into an intuitive navigation architecture and delivering a modern, visually engaging design that reflects the cooperative's commitment to serving their member-owners. The result is a professional utility website that successfully balances approachability with functionality.</p>
