                                    <h2>About AttendIT</h2>
									<p>AttendIT is a native Android application I developed alongside my teammate Jie Li as our university Capstone project. Designed for deployment in K-12 schools and higher education institutions, the platform automates attendance tracking through a dual-interface architecture serving both educators and students. The application demonstrates enterprise software design principles with distinct user roles, secure authentication, and streamlined workflow automation.</p>

                                    <!-- My testimonial here -->

                                        <p>This project represents the culmination of my formal computer science education, spanning two semesters of intensive development. The first semester focused on software engineering fundamentals, where we produced a comprehensive Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document encompassing use case diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and detailed functional requirements. The second semester involved translating these specifications into a fully functional Android application. This experience instilled rigorous software development practices including requirements gathering, system architecture design, and iterative implementation—skills that directly translate to professional enterprise software development.</p>
