                    <p>Allen Gate & Panel, Inc. is a family-owned and operated business whose doors have been open for over 25 years. Starting as a personal project by Bill and Dick Allen in 1980, we have now grown to employ over 40 people in the small town
                        of Prattsville, Arkansas where our products are manufactured. We strive to handle our customers with dignity and respect. No question or job is too small. Our business was built on taking care of individuals' needs and that is
                        what we continue to cater to today. We handle a wide variety of cattle working equipment, from panels and gates to feeders and sweep systems. You can read more on <a href="https://www.allengateandpanel.com/about/agp" target="_blank">their about page</a>.</p>

                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <!-- My testimonial here -->
                    <p>This project delivered a complete digital transformation for a 40+ year agricultural manufacturing business. The implementation features a sophisticated product catalog system enabling customers to browse equipment by category and view detailed specifications for individual products—from cattle panels and gates to feeders and sweep systems.</p>

                    <p>The architecture was intentionally designed with scalability in mind, establishing the foundation for Phase 2 enhancements including comprehensive quote request functionality and full e-commerce checkout capabilities. The responsive Tailwind CSS design ensures optimal presentation across all devices, with particular attention to visual hierarchy and brand-appropriate aesthetics that resonate with the agricultural industry audience.</p>
