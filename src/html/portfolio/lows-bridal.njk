                    <h2>About The Project</h2>
                    <!-- About us page of company here -->
                    <p><strong>Mission:</strong> Their previous website was built a long time ago. They needed to be on a more modern platform, with a fresh mobile responsive design.
                    Their old site had a directory to see all the dresses they offer but needed to be upgraded. We created a nice mobile responsive filter system on the collections page so that users
                    could see all dresses by certain designers or certain styles. Once clicking into a dresses product detail page, the user can see goregous high quality pictures of models in the dress. They can see
                    color options, sizes, more dresses by that designer, and other customers that bought this same dress.</p>

                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <!-- My testimonial here -->
                    <p>My favorite part about this project by fair was the design and the Collections page. This also is a local company to my hometown and I know friends that have used Lows Bridal to select their dress
                        for their wedding. So it was an honour to be able to help make this website better for everyone.
