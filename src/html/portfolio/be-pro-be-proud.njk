                    <h2>About The Project</h2>
                    <!-- About us page of company here -->
                    <p><strong>Mission:</strong> Be Pro Be Proud is an organization that helps students across the country get connected to schools and job for their future. They get sponsored by local companies, universities, and governments. They have
                        a truck that makes Tour Stops at highschools and demostrates different professions in the work force to the students. They have students at these events fill out a form to Join The Movement. This data can be view by sponsors. We
                        also implemented a Twilio Text Message API so that students that have joined the movement can receive marketing messages. The main issue the client had when they came to us was scalability. Previously, when a new state or province
                        would sign-up for their own Be Pro Be Proud website, the entire website would be rebuilt again as a new Wordpress application. This caused inconsistencies and differences in database structures and the client was having a hard
                        time managing all the admins in different states. Our solution was to build the client a new multi-tenant application where an unlimited amount of state sites could be created because in reality it's all the same application and
                        database, just with different domains pointing at the application, and the data in the application being scope by state id. This solution gave the client the ability to scale up quickly and consistently as they get more states
                        to sign up for new websites.</p>

                    <!-- My testimonial here -->
                    <p>This project is first time I had to build a multi-tenant application. I learned that this architecture means that only a single instance of the application is running, while serving multiple customers. It is a great architecture that
                        serves multiple use cases. We actually built two seperate multi-tenant applications for this project. The first one is the Main Be Pro State Website application, which at the time of this writing is these websites:

                    <p>The other multi-tenant application was the Join The Movement application which is where students would fill out their form to be shared with schools and employors:</p>
