                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <!-- My testimonial here -->
                    <p>This platform delivered immediate, measurable business impact—generating $70,000 in sales during the first month after launch and establishing a strong ROI for the client's technology investment.</p>

                    <p>The core technical challenge involved architecting a bidirectional integration with the Storis eBridge API, the client's enterprise inventory management platform. This integration enables real-time product catalog synchronization, automatic inventory adjustments when orders are placed, and seamless data consistency across their 18 physical retail locations and the e-commerce storefront.</p>

                    <p>A notable feature is the geolocation-enabled store finder, which I implemented using the Google Geocoding API for address-to-coordinate conversion on the backend. Customer proximity searches leverage the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/haversine-formula-to-find-distance-between-two-points-on-a-sphere/" target="_blank">Haversine formula</a> to calculate great-circle distances between coordinates. I initially implemented this algorithm in PHP, then optimized performance by refactoring the calculation into a raw SQL query—significantly reducing response times for location searches within a 100-mile radius.</p>

                    <p>The administrative backend includes comprehensive tooling that empowers the client's team to manage content, products, and promotions independently—reducing ongoing maintenance overhead and ensuring long-term platform sustainability.</p>
