                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <!-- My testimonial here -->
                    <p>This project addressed key pain points with the client's previous WordPress installation: slow performance, unintuitive backend tools, and undersized imagery that failed to showcase their impressive industrial construction work.</p>

                    <p>The redesigned platform features a sophisticated project portfolio system with large, high-resolution imagery that properly communicates the scale and quality of their work across industrial and public works projects. The custom navigation implementation required careful architectural planning to achieve the desired user experience while maintaining responsive behavior across all device sizes.</p>

                    <p>The result is a performant, visually striking platform that serves as an effective business development tool for this multi-state contractor operating across Missouri, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Arkansas.</p>
