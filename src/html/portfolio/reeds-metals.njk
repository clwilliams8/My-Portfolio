                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <!-- My testimonial here -->
                    <p>The centerpiece of this engagement was architecting an intelligent quote routing system that automatically distributes incoming leads to the appropriate location based on customer geography and preference. I implemented cookie-based session management to persist user location preferences across visits—even for unauthenticated users—ensuring quote requests are consistently routed to their preferred branch.</p>

                    <p>The location preference system integrates throughout the user experience: the interactive Google Maps display on the locations page highlights the user's preferred branch, and strategically placed call-to-action buttons throughout the product galleries enable customers to request quotes directly from the items they're viewing.</p>

                    <p>To support business operations, I developed an automated daily reporting system that delivers executive summaries showing quote volume broken down by product category and location—providing leadership with actionable insights into regional demand patterns and sales pipeline health.</p>

                    <p>This platform has proven to be a significant revenue driver for the client, demonstrating the business impact of well-architected lead management systems.</p>
