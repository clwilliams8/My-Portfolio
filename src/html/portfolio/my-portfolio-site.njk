                    <h2>About My Portfolio Site</h2>
                    <p>I developed this portfolio to provide hiring managers and technical leaders with a comprehensive view of my project experience and technical capabilities. Leveraging GitHub Pages for hosting, I implemented a solution that demonstrates both engineering proficiency and strategic resource optimization—achieving a polished, professional web presence with zero recurring hosting costs while maintaining full version control over the codebase. The architecture supports high-performance static content delivery with a clear migration path to dynamic infrastructure should future requirements demand it. The build pipeline utilizes Nunjucks templating integrated with Gulp task automation for streamlined, maintainable development workflows.</p>

                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <!-- My testimonial here -->
                    <p>In building this portfolio, I prioritized both technical excellence and operational efficiency. By selecting GitHub Pages as the hosting platform, I eliminated recurring infrastructure costs while leveraging Git-based version control for seamless continuous deployment. A key architectural decision involved implementing a modular templating system using Nunjucks with Gulp automation to enforce DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles across shared components including headers, navigation, metadata, and scripts. Source files compile from the <code>/src</code> directory to the production-ready <code>/dist</code> folder, which serves as the deployment target. I referenced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKXkC4SqtRk" target="_blank">this excellent tutorial</a> by Traversy Media to accelerate initial setup. This project showcases my ability to evaluate technology trade-offs, implement efficient build pipelines, and deliver production-quality results rapidly—the entire site was architected and deployed within a single weekend, with only the custom domain "coltons-apps.tech" as an ongoing expense.</p>
