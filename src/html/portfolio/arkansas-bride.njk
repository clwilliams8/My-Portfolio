                                    <h2>About Arkansas Bride</h2>
									<p>Since 1990, Arkansas Bride has been the No. 1 resource for Natural State brides planning their big day. It's not only the biggest bridal magazine in the state, but it is also the best online tool for soon-to-be newlyweds in search of vendors and inspiration. The magazine is published twice a year, with Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter issues. The editorial content includes a guide to 700-plus Arkansas wedding professionals, inspiring Real Weddings, styled shoots, beautiful floral and fashion shoots, and so much more! And a special supplement – Hot Springs Wedding Planner – is included inside each issue too!</p>

                                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                                    <!-- My testimonial here -->
                                        <p>This was my first major industry project executed nearly independently, and it marked our team's transition from Bootstrap to Tailwind CSS as our frontend framework. The centerpiece deliverable was a sophisticated vendor self-service portal replacing a manual phone/email workflow for 800+ wedding professionals.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Key System Features:</strong></p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Passwordless Authentication:</strong> Vendors request secure, time-limited login links—eliminating password management friction while maintaining security through server-validated, expiring parameters.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Revision-Based Workflow:</strong> Listing updates are saved as revisions rather than immediately publishing. The editorial team receives automated notifications via Laravel's <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/notifications#using-the-notifiable-trait" target="_blank">Notification system</a> to review submissions for quality and accuracy.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Approval Pipeline:</strong> Editors approve or reject revisions through an intuitive admin interface. Approved changes automatically propagate to production, triggering confirmation notifications to vendors.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Print Integration:</strong> The same vendor data powers both the website and the bi-annual print magazine, ensuring consistency across digital and physical publications.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <p>This project required architecting a complex multi-stakeholder workflow with extensive edge case handling and thorough testing to ensure reliable operation at scale—transforming a manual process into a fully automated, self-service system.</p>
