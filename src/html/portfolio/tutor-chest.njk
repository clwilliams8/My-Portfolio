                    <h2>About The Project</h2>
                    <!-- About us page of company here -->
                    <p><strong>Mission:</strong> Rescue and modernize a struggling EdTech platform following multiple unsuccessful development engagements, delivering seamless cross-platform integration and robust payment infrastructure.</p>
                    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> The client had engaged a web development agency and two freelancers, all of whom failed to deliver satisfactory results. The existing Laravel application served two user types—educators offering tutoring packages and parents searching for services—but the client faced critical issues: inability to make content updates independently (with the previous agency quoting prohibitive fees for simple changes), and failed attempts to integrate WordPress for content management while maintaining a unified domain experience.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I engineered a custom WordPress plugin exposing an API endpoint for retrieving WordPress content within the Laravel application, enabling unified domain presentation at "tutorchest.com" without subdomain complexity. I developed custom Laravel middleware to dynamically fetch and render WordPress pages on demand, creating a seamless user experience across both platforms. Additionally, I implemented Stripe payment processing via Laravel Cashier for subscription management, delivered UI/UX improvements across the Laravel application, and optimized the WordPress theme for mobile responsiveness.</p>
                    <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Laravel (Backend Framework), WordPress REST API (Content Management Integration), Laravel Cashier + Stripe (Payment Processing), Laravel Forge (Server Provisioning), Bitbucket (Version Control), Tailwind CSS (Frontend Styling).</p>

                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <!-- My testimonial here -->
                    <p>This project exemplifies my ability to diagnose complex technical challenges and deliver solutions where others have struggled. The core innovation—bridging WordPress and Laravel through custom middleware and API integration—required creative problem-solving and deep expertise in both platforms. When I began, I was uncertain whether the envisioned architecture was even feasible, but I committed to exploring the solution and delivered a fully functional implementation. Successfully rescuing this project and establishing an ongoing client partnership demonstrates my commitment to delivering results and my capability to navigate ambiguous technical requirements. Beyond the technical achievement, this platform serves a meaningful purpose: connecting families with educators to support children's learning needs—a mission that resonates with me personally.</p>
