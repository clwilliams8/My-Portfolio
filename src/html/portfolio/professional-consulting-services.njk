                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <!-- My testimonial here -->
                    <p>This greenfield project provided the opportunity to guide a client through the complete website development lifecycle—from initial concept through production deployment. I collaborated on the design process, participating in mockup iterations until achieving client approval on the visual direction.</p>

                    <p>The implementation phase involved architecting the Laravel backend infrastructure and translating approved designs into pixel-perfect, responsive frontend pages using Tailwind CSS. Delivering a first-ever web presence for an established 30+ year healthcare company required balancing modern design sensibilities with the professional credibility their industry demands.</p>

                    <p>The result is a polished digital platform that effectively communicates their service offerings and reinforces their position as industry experts in medical billing and practice management.</p>
