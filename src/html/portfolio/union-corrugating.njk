                    <h2>About Union Corrugating</h2>
                    <p>For over three-quarters of a century, Union Corrugating Company has served the metal building components market. The company was launched in 1946 when Mr. J. E. Union left West Virginia with his manually operated corrugating machine
                        and settled in Fayetteville, NC. By the early 1950s, J.E. had built a small business that was struggling to survive. You can read more on <a href="https://www.unioncorrugating.com/about-us" target="_blank">their about page</a>.</p>

                    <h2>About The Project</h2>
                    <!-- About us page of company here -->
                    <p><strong>Mission:</strong> Deliver a greenfield platform for this established metal roofing manufacturer following their acquisition of Reed's Metals (another client).

                    <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Laravel (PHP Backend Framework), Tailwind CSS (Utility-First Styling), Google Maps API (Contractor Locator Display), Google Geocode API (Address-to-Coordinate Conversion), FLEX360 CMS (Content Management), MySQL (Database), Interactive Image Processing.</p>

                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <!-- My testimonial here -->
                    <p>This project represented a significant individual contribution—I implemented approximately 90% of the application independently, encompassing both backend architecture and frontend development. The design collaboration produced a visually striking platform that effectively showcases the client's premium roofing products.</p>

                    <p>The technical foundation leverages our custom <a href="https://github.com/flex360/pilot" target="_blank">FLEX360 CMS</a> built on Laravel, providing administrators with full CRUD capabilities across all content models. I architected the database schema, implemented RESTful controllers, and connected data models to the polished frontend views.</p>

                    <p>Key features include the interactive roof visualization tool enabling customers to preview different roofing products on uploaded images of their homes, and a contractor locator powered by Google Maps and Geocoding APIs that helps customers find certified installers in their area. The project gallery showcases completed installations, serving as social proof for prospective customers evaluating their options.</p>
