                    <h2>About Union Corrugating</h2>
                    <p>For over three-quarters of a century, Union Corrugating Company has served the metal building components market. The company was launched in 1946 when Mr. J. E. Union left West Virginia with his manually operated corrugating machine
                        and settled in Fayetteville, NC. By the early 1950s, J.E. had built a small business that was struggling to survive. You can read more on <a href="https://www.unioncorrugating.com/about-us" target="_blank">their about page</a>.</p>

                    <h2>About The Project</h2>
                    <!-- About us page of company here -->
                    <p><strong>Mission:</strong> This company is in the roofing industry and had just purchased Reed's Metals which is another client of ours. Union's site was old, not responsive and needed to be a more modern platform, and have better ways
                        to receive quotes and showcase their work. We came up with a design and accomplished these task for them.</p>

                    <!-- My testimonial here -->
                    <p>I loved the design on this website. It is gorgeous. The homepage had some tricky elements to implement such as the Contractors Nationwide section, but I got the job done. The contractors page was search results was implemented the
                        same way I did it on Hank's website. I used the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/haversine-formula-to-find-distance-between-two-points-on-a-sphere/" target="_blank">Haversine Forumla</a> to find all contractors within 100
                        miles of the user's search. I also really loved the panel index and detail pages. Very pretty design.</p>
