                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <!-- My testimonial here -->
                    <p>I joined this project as part of a cohort of contractors on a 4-week engagement. When the contract period ended, I was the only developer retained—ultimately staying on the project for over 12 months as the primary full-stack developer. During this time, I led the platform through production launch, successfully executed a complex 13-step data migration from the legacy 1.0 system, and served as the main point of contact for customer support—joining Zoom calls directly with end users to diagnose issues and implement hotfixes in real-time. When the DevOps engineer departed, I assumed ownership of the infrastructure and deployment pipeline. I also collaborated closely with a second development team based in India, reviewing their pull requests, participating in daily standups, and contributing to sprint planning.</p>

                    <p><strong>Modern SPA Architecture:</strong> Built the frontend as a single-page application using the Quasar Framework, leveraging Google's Material Design guidelines to ensure accessibility compliance and intuitive UX for clinical professionals. The component-based architecture enabled rapid feature development while maintaining consistency across the platform's extensive toolset.</p>

                    <p><strong>GraphQL Implementation:</strong> Implemented a custom GraphQL layer on both frontend and Laravel backend, enabling precise data fetching where each component requests only the fields it needs. This architecture proved essential for the platform's global department switcher—when users change departments, queries are invalidated and refetched with the new context, ensuring data isolation between organizational units without full page reloads.</p>

                    <p><strong>Clinical Session Architecture:</strong> Integrated Pinia for state management across complex component hierarchies and modal dialogs used during live medical sessions. This architecture ensures seamless data collection and real-time updates as clinicians work through therapy sessions with their clients.</p>

                    <p><strong>Multi-Tenant SaaS Architecture:</strong> Implemented Tenancy For Laravel with the separated database approach, giving each tenant (schools, clinics, agencies) their own isolated PostgreSQL database. This architecture ensures complete data segregation for HIPAA/FERPA compliance while enabling the platform to be licensed to organizations nationwide with minimal onboarding friction.</p>

                    <p><strong>Container Orchestration:</strong> Deployed the platform using Docker containers orchestrated by Kubernetes, enabling horizontal scaling to handle variable load patterns—essential when hundreds of clinicians simultaneously access the system during peak therapy hours. The containerized architecture also streamlines tenant provisioning and ensures consistent environments across development, staging, and production.</p>

                    <p><strong>Compliance & Security:</strong> Implemented rigorous compliance with HIPAA and FERPA standards throughout the stack, from encrypted data storage to audit logging, protecting sensitive client information and maintaining the highest level of confidentiality for healthcare and educational data.</p>
