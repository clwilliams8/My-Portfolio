                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <!-- My testimonial here -->
                    <p>I served as the sole developer on this greenfield project, delivering the complete platform from backend architecture to frontend implementation. The client specifically required Shopify expertise, which aligned well with my skill set.</p>

                    <p>The most technically challenging component was the custom <a href="https://montanatags.com/#calclink" target="_blank">tax savings calculator</a> visible on the homepage and throughout product pages. This interactive tool implements complex business logic to calculate potential tax savings based on vehicle type, value, and the customer's home state tax rates—providing immediate, personalized value propositions that support the client's sales process.</p>

                    <p>The project was delivered on schedule and positioned the client for their marketing expansion, providing a modern, conversion-optimized platform that effectively communicates the financial benefits of Montana vehicle registration to customers nationwide.</p>
